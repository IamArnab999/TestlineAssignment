# Program Plan for Separating Text and Visual Elements from Images
Step 1: Image Analysis
We will utilize a Vision API to analyze the uploaded image. For this purpose, Google's Vision API is a good choice as it provides comprehensive image analysis, including OCR and object detection.

Step 2: Text Extraction
Using the OCR capabilities of the Vision API, we will extract all text content from the image. The text will be captured along with its coordinates within the image to help with subsequent segmentation and HTML structure.

Step 3: Visual Element Segmentation
Basic image segmentation techniques will be applied to isolate visual elements such as images, charts, or other graphics within the main image. OpenCV, a powerful computer vision library, can be used to achieve this.

Step 4: Structuring Extracted Content into HTML
We will create a basic HTML structure to sort the extracted content. Text content will be wrapped in <p> tags, and visual elements will be saved as static images and embedded using <img> tags.

Technologies and Tools
Google Vision API: For image analysis and OCR.
OpenCV: For image processing and segmentation.
Python: As the primary programming language.
Flask: For a basic web interface (optional).
# Detailed report

Approach
Image Analysis: Google Vision API was used to analyze the image and extract text.
Text Extraction: OCR capabilities of the Vision API were utilized to extract text with its coordinates.
Visual Element Segmentation: OpenCV was used to apply basic image segmentation techniques to isolate visual elements.
HTML Structure: The extracted text and segmented visual elements were structured into a basic HTML format.
Implementation
The implementation was done using Python. The Google Vision API client library was used for image analysis and OCR, while OpenCV was employed for image segmentation.
